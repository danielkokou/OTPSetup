These scripts automate the startup of the the checker and graph-builder modules on machine startup by launching them as init.d services.

e.g, for the validator instance:
 - copy the otpsetup-val file to the /etc/init.d/ directory
 - make it executable: 'chmod 755 otpsetup-val'
 - run 'update-rc.d otpsetup-val defaults'
 
The script should run at next bootup. To confirm success, list processes using 'ps aux' and confirm that "python -m otpsetup.checker.main" is running.
 
Follow a similar process for the otpsetup-gb script on the graph-builder instance.
