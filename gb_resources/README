This directory includes various libraries and templates that the graph-builder module depends on. It should be unpacked somewhere on the graph builder instance, with the path indicated in the settings file (using GRAPH_BUILDER_RESOURCE_DIR).

The following resources are already included:

gp_resources/templates -- python templates used to generate the graph-builder config file
gb_resources/graphanno -- utility to read graph-builder annotations from a built graph file
gb_resources/osmtools -- utility to contruct an osmosis extraction polygon based on GTFS data

** The following must be added manually after unpacking **

gb_resources/otpbg -- directory containing a copy of OTP's graph-builder.jar (& dependencies). OTP version should match that used on the deployment instances

gb_resources/osmosis -- a copy of the Osmosis program; download from http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis (this can be a symlink; gb_resources/osmosis/bin/osmosis should run program)
